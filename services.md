            <h2>Tutoring</h2>
        </summary>
        <p>I have over 7 years of tutoring experience in a variety of subjects (<a href="#subject-list">see list below</a>). I have helped children between the ages of 9 and 18 succeed in their educational goals, including children with learning disabilities and special needs.</p>
        <p>When working with a new student, my approach is to create measurable and actionable goals with them, and to determine the student's most impactful learning styles as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>I am available for either year-round or on-demand tutoring sessions. Sessions can be flexible, either following a customized curriculum or dedicated to just homework help.</p>
