                This is my personal website, and it is obviously <strong>very unfinished</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is a work in progress, but I'm mostly focusing on other projects at the moment.
                However, there is some stuff to look at for now...
            </p>
        </MainLayout>
    );
